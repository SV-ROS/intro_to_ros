## Simple talker demo that listens to std_msgs/Strings published 
## to the 'chatter' topic
#
# 2017 Alan Federman SV-ROS
#
# A simple listener for the SV_ROS (from neato_node) the listens to see if 
# the bumper has been pressed on a Botvac.
#
# This code can be incuded in navigation scripts to halt or turn the robot if 
# the bumper has been pressed
#
# the values are Left_Bumper Right_Bumper Left_Side_Bumper Right_Side_Bumper
#
# to use install in catkin_ws in a node subdirectory on your laptop for example
# /catkin_ws/src/test/src  and rosrun test bumper.py -- of course set the master
# and launch the base on the Botvac.
